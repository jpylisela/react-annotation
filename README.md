# React Annotation

Welcome to React Annotation!

This application lets you add markers on the screen, edit them and keep them intact after a page reload.

Main repository: https://github.com/jpylisela/react-annotation


## Setup

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Run `yarn` (or `npm install`).
3. Run `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`) to start the dev server.


## How To Add Markers

- Right-click on the screen, and select "Add Marker"
- Input text and save by clicking the save icon


## To Do

- save the markers to a database
- add deletion of markers on marker right-click
- add dragging of marker positions
- improve the UI
- make the solution much more environment-agnostic, and added multiple options for icon type and skinning
- add an option to use the solution in a component that is not full screen wide
- use ID's instead of index to render markers, if I had actual ID's available from the database (for best practices)
- add unit tests
- document more
- add internalization
- make the solution into its own package and publish to npm registry
- replace the dragon icon with something else..
